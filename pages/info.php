
<b>Description</b>
<p>Carpooling reduces the costs involved in car travel by sharing
	journey expenses such as fuel, tolls, and car rental between the people
	travelling. Carpooling is also seen as a more environmentally friendly
	and sustainable way to travel as sharing journeys reduces carbon
	emissions, trac on the roads, and the need for parking spaces.</p>

<b>How it Works</b>
<p>Drivers and passengers can search for journeys through one of the
	several mediums available. After finding a match they contact each
	other to arrange any details for the journey(s). Costs, meeting points
	and other details like space for luggage are discussed and agreed on.
	They then meet and carry out their shared car journey(s) as planned.</p>

<b>Features: </b>
<p>
	<b>User Profiling</b>: A user profile is a collection of personal data
	associated to a specific user and it may include information about her
	identity, her reputation, the journeys she has created or participated,
	the distance (in km) she has used carpooling, the amount of money (in
	$) she has saved, and perhaps an enviromental consciousness index based
	on less air polluting act due to carpooling.
</p>

<p>
	<b>User Interactions</b>: A user can act either as driver or passenger.
	As a driver she can add a new journey, select passengers (from the
	interested ones), rate passengers. As a passenger she can navigate
	through the available journeys, express interest to join a journey,
	rate a driver.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Implicit Social Networking</b>: In this social network users that
	have participated in a carpooling for at least one time are
	automatically considered `friends'.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Reputation System</b>: As a user, you are able to give reputation
	scores for drivers and passengers that participate in journeys with
	you. These scores will then be published based on a collection of
	opinions. The opinions are typically passed as ratings (like/dislike,
	star system, 1-10 grade, etc.) to the reputation system which uses a
	reputation algorithm to dynamically compute the reputation scores based
	on the received ratings.
